# cs610-S2019-syllabus

This repository contains the syllabus for Computer Science 610 Spring 2019. To
learn more about the course for which this syllabus was created, please
visit the [Computer Science 600 Fall 2018 GitHub
Organization](https://github.com/Allegheny-CS-SeniorThesis-2018). All of
the LaTeX files in this repository are automatically compiled with [Travis
CI](https://travis-ci.org/), thus ensuring that they compile correctly and,
moreover, that a PDF of each assignment is available in the GitHub repository
whenever a commit is tagged for a release.

## Accessing the Syllabus

Since this repository primarily contains LaTeX source code, the Travis CI
configuration for it will compile the source code and automatically release a
PDF of the source code whenever the last commit is associated with a [Git
Tag](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging). As such, this will
cause a PDF file to become available in the listing of the
[Releases](https://github.com/Allegheny-CS-600-2018/syllabus/releases)
for this repository. All release numbers in this repository adhere to the
[Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) standard.

## Problems or Praise

If you have any problems with compiling the syllabus, then please create an
issue in this repository using the "Issues" link at the top of this site.
If you are unable to compile the syllabus with your development tools and
your execution environment, then please open a new issue and we will attempt
to resolve your concerns.
